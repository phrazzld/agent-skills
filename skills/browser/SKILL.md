  Pick the right browser automation tool for a given task — across web and
  Electron apps, from CI tests to autonomous agents. Browser automation in
  2026 is a testing pyramid: deterministic Playwright E2E at the base,
  AI-assisted helpers in the middle, persona-driven exploratory agents on
  top, and continuous QA agents against staging/production on top of that.
  Findings flow down (discoveries harden into deterministic tests), not up.
  Encodes the pyramid, the four-layer tool taxonomy (driver/mode/wrapper/
  infra), the three distinct Playwright surfaces, and the load-bearing
  gotchas (agent() token trap, Spectron deprecation, runtime vs authoring-
  time AI, when selectors beat AI and when they don't).
  Use for: "automate the browser", "script this flow", "test this web
  app", "test this electron app", "scrape this site", "should I use
  Playwright or Stagehand", "which browser tool", "browser agent",
  "exploratory QA", "persona testing", "continuous QA", "synthetic
  monitoring", "puppet this UI", "headless chrome", "visual regression",
  "E2E tests", "self-healing tests", "autonomous QA".

# /browser

Browser automation is a **testing pyramid**, not a single tool. Pick the
layer first, then the tool for that layer.

## The Pyramid

| Layer | Purpose | Tooling |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **4. Continuous QA** | scheduled agents, autonomous bug filing, synthetic monitoring against staging/prod | Custom Browser Use / Stagehand loops, bugAgent, QA.tech, Mabl, supaguard |
| **3. Exploratory / Persona-driven** | cold-start exploration with a persona, charters, SBTM/PROOF reports, UX-gap discovery | Browser Use, Stagehand `agent()`, agent-browser, custom persona harnesses |
| **2. Hybrid / AI-assisted** | Playwright body + AI for fragile steps, self-healing, AI-authored tests committed to repo | Playwright 1.56+ Planner/Generator/Healer, Stagehand atomic primitives, QA Wolf / Octomind (generate code), visual regression |
| **1. Deterministic Playwright E2E** | critical user journeys, CI gate, 99%+ reliable, regression floor | Raw Playwright code, Playwright Test, fixtures, `getByRole` |

**Findings flow down, not up.** The exploratory layer is a *discovery
instrument*. When an agent persona finds a real bug or UX gap, harden
the repro into a Layer 1 or Layer 2 test. Do not use runtime agents as
release gates — they're stochastic by construction.

**Generate-once vs run-every-time.** QA Wolf / Octomind / Playwright's
Planner use AI at **authoring time** and produce deterministic Playwright
code committed to the repo. Stagehand atomic / Browser Use use AI at
**runtime**, paying LLM cost on every execution. Authoring-time AI is
the production sweet spot; runtime AI is for fragile surfaces, one-off
flows, and exploration.

For the full pyramid rationale, persona patterns, SBTM/PROOF reporting,
and commercial landscape, read `references/pyramid.md`.

## The Four Tool Layers

Orthogonal to the pyramid, every browser-automation stack assembles four
layers. Pick one per layer.

1. **Driver** — what speaks to the browser.
   Playwright (universal — default), Puppeteer (Chrome-only — stay on
   it if you're on it), Selenium (legacy, multi-language — only for
   existing Java/C# investment).

2. **Mode** — who drives actions.
   Scripted (selectors; cheap; breaks on UI change); hybrid (code + LLM-
   resolved step per action — Stagehand's `act("click login")`);
   full agent (LLM plans and drives — Browser Use).

3. **Wrapper** — the library or MCP the agent codes against.
   Raw Playwright / Puppeteer / Selenium (zero LLM cost); **Stagehand**
   (four primitives on top of Playwright/Puppeteer/CDP, TS-first);
   **Browser Use** (full-agent wrapper on Playwright, Python-first);
   **agent-browser** (Vercel Rust CLI, compact output, lowest tokens);
   **Playwright MCP** (Microsoft's official, ax-tree snapshots).

4. **Infrastructure** — where the browser actually runs.
   Local Chromium (free, private, CI-friendly); **Browserbase** (hosted
   with stealth, proxies, auto-CAPTCHA, session recording/inspector);
   **Real Chrome attached** (Claude-in-Chrome extension, or
   `@playwright-repl/mcp` Dramaturg — not a CI tool by design).

Most production stacks: **Playwright driver → chosen mode → wrapper →
local or Browserbase**.

For per-tool setup and capability detail, read `references/tools.md`.

## The Three Playwrights

"Playwright" means three different things with very different cost
profiles. Don't conflate them.

| Surface | Tokens per action | What's happening |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Raw Playwright (code)** | 0 | You write TS/Python. No LLM in the loop. |
| **Playwright CLI** (`@playwright/cli`) | ~0 | Snapshots/screenshots write to disk; agent reads files on demand. |
| **Playwright MCP** (`@playwright/mcp`) | 200–400 per snapshot, builds up across a session | Accessibility tree streams into context every call. The "heavy" one. |

Raw Playwright is the most token-efficient option in the entire space.
Playwright MCP is the "heavy" one people complain about. Reach
accordingly.

## Decision Matrix (by pyramid layer)

| Layer | Task | Stack |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | CI E2E on known flows | Playwright Test, raw code, local Chromium |
| 1 | Electron app E2E | Playwright `_electron` + `electron-playwright-helpers` |
| 2 | AI-authored tests committed to repo | Playwright Planner/Generator/Healer (1.56+), or QA Wolf / Octomind (commercial) |
| 2 | Self-healing flaky selectors | Stagehand atomic primitives on the fragile step only |
| 2 | Visual regression | Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()`, Applitools, or agent-browser pixel diff |
| 2 | Agent debugging a live app | Playwright MCP + Chrome DevTools MCP |
| 3 | Structured extraction from fragile UI (TS) | Stagehand `extract()` with Zod schema |
| 3 | Persona-driven exploratory QA | Browser Use or Stagehand `agent()` with persona prompt, SBTM/PROOF report |
| 3 | Token-conscious exploration loop | agent-browser CLI (compact snapshots by design) |
| 3 | Exploratory QA in my logged-in Chrome | Claude-in-Chrome MCP or `@playwright-repl/mcp` (Dramaturg) |
| 4 | Scheduled staging/prod QA with bug filing | Browser Use or Stagehand in CI/cron + bug-filing integration |
| 4 | Synthetic monitoring with AI classification | supaguard, or custom Playwright + Claude classifier |
| any | Anti-bot site, scale, session replay | Any of the above **+ Browserbase** |

## Load-Bearing Gotchas

- **Spectron is deprecated.** Electron = Playwright `_electron` +
  `electron-playwright-helpers`. See `references/electron.md`.
- **Stagehand's `agent()` is the expensive failure mode.** One-shot goals
  can balloon to 500k+ tokens. Atomic `act`/`extract`/`observe` runs at
  ~7k tokens/step with caching. In the pyramid, `agent()` belongs in
  Layer 3 (exploration), not Layer 2 (production flows).
- **Stagehand, Browser Use, and Browserbase stack — they don't compete.**
  Stagehand wraps Playwright; Browser Use wraps Playwright via CDP;
  Browserbase is infrastructure under any of them. "Stagehand vs
  Browserbase" is a category error.
- **Browser Use is autonomy-optimized, not token-optimized.** It burns
  2–5s per action and $0.02–0.30 per task on planning overhead. Worth
  it for genuinely open-ended exploration; wasteful if you already know
  the steps.
- **Runtime agents are not release gates.** They're stochastic. Use them
  for discovery (Layer 3/4); harden findings into deterministic tests
  at Layer 1/2. "Agentic runtime as CI gate" is the pattern reddit
  practitioners warn against.
- **Claude-in-Chrome and Dramaturg are not CI tools.** They attach to
  your *real* Chrome — auth, cookies, open tabs persist. That's the
  feature.
- **"AI beats selectors" is situational.** On stable UIs, a CSS selector
  is faster, cheaper, and 100% deterministic. LLM-resolved actions cost
  $0.002–0.02 each. Reach for AI only when selectors genuinely break
  often (15–25%/month on fast-moving UIs) or the UI is ambiguous.
- **Puppeteer has no Firefox or WebKit.** New project = Playwright.
- **Language ecosystem is a real constraint.** Stagehand is TS-first
  (Python bindings lag). Browser Use is Python-first. Choose to match
  your codebase.
- **Commercial SaaS QA platforms** (QA.tech, Mabl, Rainforest, Momentic)
  compress the pyramid into one vendor. Convenient, but lock you in
  and often can't export tests as Playwright code. Octomind and QA Wolf
  explicitly output deterministic Playwright — prefer those if you
  want escape-hatch ownership.
- **Browserbase's value is anti-bot + observability, not just hosting.**
  No bot detection + no session replay need = local Chromium is cheaper.

## Existing Spellbook Integrations

- **Vercel `agent-browser`** registered in `registry.yaml` (pin
  `4cc6ca40`) as `vercel-agent-browser`. Layer 3 default for
  token-conscious exploration loops.
- **Vercel `dogfood`** (`vercel-dogfood`) pairs with `agent-browser` for
  "dogfood your own product" — repro-first bug documentation inside a
  running app. Layer 3 pattern.
- **`/qa`** has a QA-scoped setup reference at
  `skills/qa/references/browser-tools.md` for the tools above used in
  QA evidence capture. This skill is the broader selection judgment;
  `/qa` is the workflow that consumes the tools.

## Output

When routing a task, state:
1. Which **pyramid layer** the task belongs to.
2. Which **tool layers** (driver/mode/wrapper/infra) you're picking.
3. The stack — one line per tool layer.
4. The gotcha most likely to bite.
5. Cost estimate if any runtime-LLM tool is in the stack.
