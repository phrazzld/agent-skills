# /harness audit — Skill Health Assessment

Analyze skill invocation data to assess skill health, identify waste, and
recommend lifecycle actions.

## Data Source

Read `~/.claude/skill-invocations.jsonl`. Each line is a JSON object:
`{"ts": "ISO8601", "skill": "name", "args": "...", "session_id": "...", "cwd": "...", "project": "..."}`.

If the file doesn't exist or is empty, report: "No invocation data found.
Skill invocations are tracked automatically via PostToolUse hook. Once you
have data, re-run `/harness audit`."

## Flags

- `--since <duration>` — filter to recent data (e.g., `30d`, `7d`, `90d`).
  Default: all data.
- `--skill <name>` — deep-dive on a single skill instead of the full report.

## Full Report (default)

### 1. Frequency Table

| Skill | Invocations | Last Used | Projects |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|

Sort by invocation count descending.

### 2. Health Categories

Classify each installed skill (read `skills/*/SKILL.md` for the full list):

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Hot** | >10 invocations in period | Keep, consider investing (deeper references, sub-modes) |
| **Warm** | 3-10 invocations | Keep, monitor |
| **Cold** | 1-2 invocations | Evaluate: niche or dead? |
| **Dead** | 0 invocations in period | Candidate for deprecation |

### 3. Consolidation Candidates

Flag skills that:
- Are always invoked in sequence (A then B in the same session → merge into A)
- Share >50% of trigger phrases with another skill (description overlap)
- Have complementary domains that could be one skill without exceeding 3 workflows

### 4. Recommendations

For each skill, emit one of:
- **keep** — healthy, earning its description tax
- **invest** — hot skill, would benefit from deeper references or sub-modes
- **deprecate** — dead or cold with no clear niche
- **merge [target]** — consolidation candidate, specify merge target
- **split** — exceeding mode-bloat gate
- **promote** — project-local skill used across >2 projects, promote to global

### 5. Description Tax Report

Count installed skills (from `skills/*/SKILL.md`). Estimate ~100 tokens per
skill description, always loaded. Report total. Flag if >2,000 tokens (20+ skills).

## Deep-Dive Report (--skill flag)

For a single skill:

- Invocation timeline (count by week or month)
- Project breakdown: which projects use it most
- Session co-occurrence: which other skills fire in the same sessions
- Recommendations: specific, actionable

## Output Format

Structured markdown. Tables and bullets only. No prose filler.
End with a **TLDR**: 3-5 bullet summary of the most actionable findings.
